# Example Instrumented Ecommerce App

This is an online shop built for demonstrating observability.

It demonstrates instrumenting and debugging a live application using Datadog, with logs, metrics, and distributed tracing.

We use Katacoda and gor to spin up our own (dysfunctional) stores, and then diagnose and fix them with replayed live traffic.
